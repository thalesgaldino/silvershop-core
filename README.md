# SilverShop Module

The SilverShop module aims to provide developers with a framework for building, and customising ecommerce-based projects.
It includes facilities for customers to browse products and place orders, and for administrators to manage products and orders.
We've put a strong focus on testing, and thanks to TravisCI, you can see the [build status](https://travis-ci.org/silvershop/silvershop-core) of this project, running on MySQL, SQLite, Postgres, as well as a few different versions of PHP.
